# Introduction

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

## Selected Models for Best Fit

Our model ranking is as follows:

1. Truncated Logistic
2. Discrete Weibull (Type III)

These two models had the lowest AIC () and BIC () values when looking at the model comparisons below:

## Selecting Range of Useful Data

From our testing we found that using 70% of the data gets the best results. Using the range of data points 1-55 (70%) of the data we get the lowest AIC and BIC values without grossly overfitting to the data.

## Displaying Graphs

Here you can see both graphs displayed together onto the data.

## Discussing Acceptable Range of Failure Rate


# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

## MTTFmin = 0.0038

## MTTFmin half = 0.0019

## MTTFmin twice = 0.0076

# Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decide the MTTFmin

We used the "Data6.dat" file as input for failure data and we generated the reliability demonstration chart using the RDC Excel tool. We then experimented with various values for FIO, which helped us pinpoint the one where the plotted line falls just within the acceptable region of the chart. This yielded an approximate MTTFmin of 0.0038.

In the first graph, where the MTTFmin=0.0038, the line starts within the 'continue' region but gradually transitions into the acceptable region. Conversely, in the next graph where MTTFmin is halved, the line quickly enters the 'accept' region, signifying the reliablity of the SUT. And finally, upon doubling MTTFmin, the line moves into the 'reject' region, deeming it unacceptale and below the required standard.
