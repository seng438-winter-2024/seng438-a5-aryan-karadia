# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

## Selected Models for Best Fit

Our model ranking is as follows:

1. Littlewood
2. Geometric

This is due to the fact that the Littlewood model has a lower Kolmogorov distance therefore it has a better "goodness-of-fit" between the two models.

## Selecting Range of Useful Data

## Displaying Graphs

Comparing the results of the Geometric model and Littlewood below, we see that the Littlewood model has a lower Kolomogorov Distance value. Littlewood has a value of `kolmogorov Distance: 0.1587030780363099` where as Geometric has a value of `kolmogorov Distance: 0.17136837903631075`.
