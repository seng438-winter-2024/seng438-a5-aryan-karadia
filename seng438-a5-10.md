# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

## Selected Models for Best Fit

Our model ranking is as follows:

1. Truncated Logistic
2. Discrete Weibull (Type III)

These two models had the lowest AIC () and BIC () values when looking at the model comparisons below:

## Selecting Range of Useful Data

From our testing we found that using 70% of the data gets the best results. Using the range of data points 1-55 (70%) of the data we get the lowest AIC and BIC values without grossly overfitting to the data.

## Displaying Graphs

Here you can see both graphs displayed together onto the data.
